I achieved my code results by working with a tutor from Wyzant.com for 2.5 hours  as well as asked Janki for assistance with a previous error in the code. 

Variables, sheet numbers and dimensions were set. Mathematical calculaculations to their assigned columns were entered, calculating percentage change, yearly change, and total volume.
